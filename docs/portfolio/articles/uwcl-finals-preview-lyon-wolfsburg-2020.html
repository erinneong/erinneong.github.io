  <div class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Text"><p class="Text__Content"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">European football has made its return for the women's game, and the upcoming UEFA Women's Champions League (UWCL) finals will pit title-holders and French champions, Olympique Lyonnais, against the German champions VfL Wolfsburg. It will be a star-studded matchup featuring several players who are prominent figures not just for their clubs, but for their national teams.

Lyon will be heading into their ninth ever UWCL final and have the opportunity to further extend their record as the winningest team in the competition's history—what would be a five-year streak and seven championships total.

Wolfsburg themselves are no stranger to legacies of dominance, having clinched the European crown twice and racked up a streak of four straight Frauen-Bundesliga titles.

The last time these two teams featured in a UWCL finals, Lyon won the match handily, putting four past the German side and only ceding a lone goal back in 2018. The following year, the outcome was much the same; the French club again proved triumphant, 6-3 on aggregate, in their quarterfinal meeting.

But while history has clearly favored one side, it does not always predict outcomes.

<h3 class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Heading Heading--3"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString" style="font-size:22px; margin-top:2rem; margin-bottom:1.3rem;"><strong>The Story So Far</strong></span></span></h3>

It was a narrow escape for Lyon en route to their fifth consecutive finals berth. The French club went two goals up over quarterfinal opponents FC Bayern Munich, the second place team from the Frauen-Bundesliga, but looked more rattled than expected throughout the game. Carolin Simon scored one back in the 64th minute, offering Bayern a lifeline and scaring Lyon into making defensive substitutions. Ultimately, though, the defending champions managed to hold off the fightback, 2-1.

Their semi-final meeting with French runners-up Paris-Saint Germain (PSG) had also been a tough back-and-forth affair, going down to 10-a-side after players from both squads were sent off in the second half. Captain Wendie Renard's header was the only goal separating the two sides after the final whistle, 1-0.

Wolfsburg, on the other hand, had a blitzing 9-1 victory over Glasgow City FC in the quarterfinals, demolishing the Scottish side. In addition to Ingrid Sys Engen's brace, Pernille Harder masterfully completed a hat-trick and yet again showcased her eminence for the German club. The Danish striker is tied-second for most goals scored this campaign with none other than Lyon's Ada Hegerberg, both with nine goals to their name.

Edging FC Barcelona, 1-0, courtesy of Fridolina Rolfö, Wolfsburg's semi-final outing was a lot more subdued, though not lacking in intent. Both sides threatened close to the opposite box, with the Spanish club dominating on possession and passing. Wolfsburg had more shots on target, however, and had the one that counted in the end.

<h3 class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Heading Heading--3"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString" style="font-size:22px; margin-top:2rem; margin-bottom:1.3rem;"><strong>Key Angles</strong></span></span></h3>

Set pieces have been pivotal in this year's competition. Engen nodded one home for Wolfsburg off a Lena Goeßling corner against Glasgow, while both of Lyon's match-winners in the previous rounds were converted from free kicks—with much thanks to Amel Majri, who provided the assist against PSG and shot the decisive goal herself against Bayern. It would not be surprising if these similarly spell the difference during the finals, and here, the heading ability of the likes of Alexandra Popp may become even more important, be it on the offensive or defensive end.

While playing more centrally than her usual forward role, Popp's headers in the game against Glasgow proved just as vital in winning aerial duels in the middle of the pitch as they have been in sending the ball into the back of the net. It will be interesting to see whether she will be allowed to move into more advanced positions, and how she might supplement an attacking threat with Harder up front.

Both teams also like operating through the flanks; Lyon press treacherously high, and Wolfsburg relish free-flowing football. Svenja Huth remains a grilling and tireless force for the German club, and is one to count on to deliver quality crosses from the wing. But while both are fully capable of stringing together attacks with one-two-touch passing, it will be interesting to see whether one side opts for a more defensive strategy.

The title-holders, despite the gritty playmaking they exude, might just go down that route, given that their two of their strikers are unavailable for the match ahead. Hegerberg has been sitting out due to injury; in her stead, Nikita Parris had stepped up for Lyon, valiantly nodding in the opening goal during the quarterfinals. But she will fail to see the campaign through as she will have to serve a suspension after picking up a second yellow in the game against PSG.

Nevertheless, the French champions are still sound defensively, relying on the likes of Renard and Lucy Bronze. Japanese international Saki Kumagai has also stepped up in keeping control over the pitch, especially with defensive midfielder Amandine Henry also out injured. Indeed, the finals could turn into a narrative of Harder and co's creativity in breaking defensive lines vis-a-vis Lyon's resoluteness in stifling threats and flipping the switch to demonstrate quick attacking intent.

Under the circumstances, Dzsenifer Marozsán could be the crucial centerpiece in the finale. While the maestro provides excellent service in dead ball situations, the squad may also benefit from bringing the ball in deeper—enabling Marozsán to get more touches on the ball and create chances from fluid play.

Still, the untimely absence of multiple star players is an added shake-up to Lyon's system that coach Jean-Luc Vasseur will have to deal with, and the unfamiliarity could well be enough to sow doubt into an otherwise confident and steadfast side.

<h3 class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Heading Heading--3"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString" style="font-size:22px; margin-top:2rem; margin-bottom:1.3rem;"><strong>Game of Giants</strong></span></span></h3>

A reduced sharpness on the attacking front is perhaps the main weakness that opponents have been looking to exploit to dethrone the European champions. So far, many have tried but none have succeeded in that mission, though some teams like PSG and Bayern have come close. But close doesn't quite cut it, especially not against a squad of Lyon's caliber.

The French powerhouse has not lost in a long time, their last defeat coming at the hands of PSG, 1-0, during the Coupe de France Feminine final in May 2018. Now Wolfsburg will be next in line to try and put a halt to that undefeated streak and become one among the rare blemishes on an otherwise fairly pristine record spanning years across different competitions. And they might just be equipped with the proper technique and intensity to do it.

It is difficult to discount Lyon, however, when they've been the UWCL title-holders for the past four years running. The defending champions are certainly at the pinnacle of women's football globally, and even with a few missing pieces, their tenacity and experience still make for a side not so easily toppled—the squad looking stable enough to keep the European trophy within their grasp.

But perhaps now is as great an opportunity as any for a challenger as formidable as Wolfsburg to rise and pick apart Lyon's scarce vulnerabilities. Both teams can be vicious in dismantling their opponents, but it will require that they keep their composure to emerge the victors. An exciting UWCL finals awaits, and fans are sure to be treated to a fiery class of quality football.</span></span></p></div>
